# APP for getting IPL Scores

## How's it made?
It is made using React Native framework where react is used for frontend and it is connected to an Api in the backend which is made in heroku.
<br>
This heroku Api is found in another repository of mine which link is this:- https://github.com/aditya-chari25/api_iplscores
<br>
This React front-end consists of three pages stacked together:-
